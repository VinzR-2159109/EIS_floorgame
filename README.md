## Floor Games

The Floor Game project features two engaging games: Color Match and Pong designed for motion-based interaction within a calibrated play area. 

- **Color Match**: Players navigate a grid of tiles, following specific hand gestures to match tile states and avoid penalties.  
- **Pong**: Players control paddles by moving their bodies to hit a ball, with the challenge increasing as the ball's speed accelerates.

Both games emphasize real-time responsiveness and dynamic player tracking, creating an interactive and competitive environment. Despite challenges in calibration accuracy, player differentiation, and CPU performance, the project successfully delivers immersive gameplay while providing opportunities for future enhancements.
